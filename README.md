# Symfony-DigitalXBO-Website
A website for DigitalXBO using Symfony, MySQL and vanilla jquery. ***find in master branch***
# Routes
-for this website, I only needed to create a route to retrieve the job information from the database. However, I have experimented with more stuff from the symfony docs (namely, making a form and retrieving its information)  
- I planned to make another route to apply for the job by making a form (following this link https://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html). But I had given myself 5 days (Wednesday - Monday) to finish the project, So i cut the feature out of the website but am making sure to implement it on my own time.  
# Static version on S3
I also made a static version of the website with hard-coded values for the jobs instead of retrieving them from the database. Here is the link to access it to see the design of the website: http://digitalxbo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
